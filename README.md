# Image-Over-Slider-Effect

<h2>How it works to moves across the image ?</h2>

Image Over Slider works by stacking two images on top of each other. As the example slider moves across the image, it makes use of the CSS clip property to trim the image on the left or right vies-versa. This allows the image on the right to show through the container.

In the design we are using custom movement events jquery.event.move Jquery library in order to support 1:1 slider movement on mobile devices.
